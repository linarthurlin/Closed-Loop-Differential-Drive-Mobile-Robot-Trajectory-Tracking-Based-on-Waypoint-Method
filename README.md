# Closed-Loop Differential Drive Mobile Robot Trajectory Tracking Based on Waypoint Method
 
##Descriptions:
The project is about ***Waypoin Control***, a method of trajectory tracking, on a closed-loop differential drive mobile robot. We simulated the robot and the trajectory results using MATLAB and CoppliaSim.

##Tools:
MATLAB, CoppeliaSim
